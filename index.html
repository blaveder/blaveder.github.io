<p>I am 36 years old, and married to an United States Army soldier. She has been gone now for 8 months and got 8 months to go.I live with my dog in West Valley City in my house.  I a veteran of the Navy, my rank was BM3 (SW). I recieved several awards including the ESWS pin. I was stationed on the USS Carl Vinson. That was the ship that had bin laden. So...there is that</p>
<p>I have , besides the navy, been doing front end web development and design since 2002. I have been lead designer at two locations and currently working for <a href="https://www.daz3d.com" title="Daz 3D">Daz 3D</a> its hard to explain what we do...so click the link. I design the promotional pages of the products. they go up every day so i have to design, code and publish a html every day along with an e-mail.</p>
<p>I am hoping to increase my knowledge to help further my career. I also would like to learn back end program to open up my job opportunities in live.</p>
